    #Exercise 2: Write a program that uses input to prompt a user for their name and then welcomes them.
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello "+name)

    #Exercise 3: Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour to compute gross pay.
# hours=int(input("Enter hours: "))
# rate = float(input("enter rate: "))
# print("Pay: "+str(round(hours*rate, 2)))

    #Exercise 4: Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:
# width = 17
# height = 12.0
# print("Value is : ", width // 2, "and type is: " ,type(width // 2))
# print("Value is : ", width / 2.0 ,"and type is: " , type(width / 2.0))
# print("Value is : ", height / 3 ,"and type is: " , type(height / 3))
# print("Value is :" , 1 + 2 * 5,"and type is: " , type(1 + 2 * 5))

    #Exercise 5: Write a program which prompts the user for a Celsius temperature, convert the temperature to Fahrenheit, and print out the converted temperature.
# Cel=int(input("Write the C temperature outside: "))
# Far = round(float((Cel*9/5)+32),2)
# print("Celcium is: ", Cel, "Fahrenheit is: ", Far)
